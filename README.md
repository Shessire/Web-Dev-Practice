<p align="left">This repository contains code snippets and chunks of code that I have learned along the way while mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Itâ€™s still not a finished project (might be in the future), but rather a collection of small experiments, concepts, and learning exercises that Iâ€™ve documented as I progress.

Iâ€™ll be adding more features and sections in the future as I continue building and refining my skills in full-stack web development.

Feel free to explore and check back for updates as the project evolves! ðŸ˜€

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

**Server:** Node.js, Express.js

**Database:** MongoDB


## Lessons Learned

**1. Future Enhancements**

Although this repository contains code chunks and learning exercises, more features and projects will be added in the future as I continue expanding my knowledge of the MERN stack.

*------------- Many more to come, hopefully --------------*
